# Kickstarter-Analysis
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends.
## Overview of Project
### Purpose
- The purpose of this project was to assist Louise in comparing and unconvering trends between plays that have been funded for and released in previous years to make a conclusion and prediction on how successful her play could be by analyzing other play's outcomes based on launch dates, goals, and various other characteristics.  By using filters, pivot tables and charts, conditional formatting, bar charts, and the use of the Vlookup and Central Tendency formulas, we were able to select the most crucial and important data for Louise and organize the cluttered, original worksheet into seperate sheets containing specific, filtered data with clear conclusions and visual observations.  Our goal was to take the original data given and create a more readable and organized worksheet where our conclusions could give Louise clear indications on which actions she should take to release a succesful, well-funded Play.  
## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
- Through filtering the data to only select our category to Theater and creating a chart to view Theaters' outcome (success, failed, or canceled) compared to the month it was released, we concluded that the most succcessful plays were released during the start and end of Summer.  The most succesful plays, about 111, came out during May.  Then, the success rate begins to drop but still remains most successful compared to the rest of the year.  In June, there were 100 succesful plays and in July, there were 87 succesful plays.  For the rest of months of the year, successful plays stayed around 70 and below.  Therefore, we would suggest Louise to release her play during the Summer, closer to May.
- We could also conclude that towards the end of the year, most plays aren't as succesful compared to other months.  When looking at the Successful and Failed line on the Line chart, we can conclude that plays tend to have a worse outcome as October hits until December.  Therefore, with the analysis of the outcomes based on launch Date, Louise can infer when it would be best to release a play and when it would be worst by our visualization of data representing the outcome of previously released plays.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
- We filtered our data to only show Theater outcomes compared to their goals.  By using a CountIf formula, we were able to find how many plays were successful in terms of the amount they had listed as their goal.  We seperated our goal amounts in specific increments and then analyzed the percentage successful, failed, or cancelled compared to how much they had planned to raise as their goal amount for the play.  As the goal amount increased, there were less plays with that goal amount so, it was difficult to conclude that if a play would have a larger goal, then it would usually be more succesful even though this chart showed that at times.  Our best conclusion would infer that those with lower goal amounts listed tneded to have more succesful oputcomes.  Since we had more data to compare with plays that had lower goal amounts, we were able to analyze that with lower goals in mind, the easier it would be to achieve those goals and in turn, have a succesful play. We realized that out of 186 plays with a goal amount less than 1000, 141 plays had a successful outcome. Usually, with a lower goal, the pledged amount will rise above, creating more chances of being succesful.  As the goal amount increased, less and less plays were able to be succesful.  
- This conclusion is clear by just looking at the success line, but by also looking at the failed data, the same conclusion is made where the percentage of failed plays continued to increase as the goal amount increased.  Therefore, Louise should have a smaller, more realisitc goal closer to 1000 in order to have more chances of being successful.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
- Some challenges I faced with this dataset was the amount of unecessary data not specific to what Louise was trying to unconver.  The original worksheet contained data on not just plays, but various categories including over 50 different ones.  We had to split our categories first in two subcategories and then filter our data to only grab Theaters.  Initially, I had trouble trying to analyze what information was the most valuable and important for Louise to make observations with and clear conclusions based off this worksheet of cluttered data.  I think one of the most difficult processes when first opening a worksheet full of data is taking the time to analyze all data and then making decisions on which you believe is most valuable for our specific goal in mind.  Once you decide on the data that is valuable to your task, then you must decide how you are going to transform this data into a visual representation of conclusions. 
## Results
- Other possible tables and graphs we could've used was a Stacked Column bar chart showing each seperate bar for months and then showing how many plays were successful, failed, or cancelled being signified with different colors.   We could've also created a Pie Chart for each outcome.  100% of the pie chart equating a full year, therefore, we could have each month equating to the percentage of plays that were successful, failed, or cancelled throughout the year.  
In conclusion, Louise now knows when during the year she should release her play which is starting in May until August, since Summer has proven to be most successful for plays.  Louise also knows that having a higher goal amount leads to more failed and cancelled plays, therefore, by having a low goal that is much easier to meet and overachieve, will lead to a higher chance of having a successful play.  Two crucial aspects were learned from our analysis of data that were simply conveyed to Louise by two visualizations on specific data.
